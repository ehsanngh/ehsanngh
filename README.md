### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a computational scientist with a passion for leveraging computational models and algorithms to address complex scientific problems. As a Ph.D. candidate at Michigan State University, my research integrates physics-informed machine learning with traditional numerical methods to develop real-time, subject-specific cardiovascular models. This work aims to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of medical diagnostics and treatments.

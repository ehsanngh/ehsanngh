### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a graduate researcher at Michigan State University. My interests lie at the intersection of engineering and computer science. In my current role, I am focused on the development of real-time, patient-specific models by integrating physics-informed machine learning with traditional numerical methods. My objective is to facilitate efficient inverse modeling and parameter estimation, contributing to the evolution of personalized treatments.

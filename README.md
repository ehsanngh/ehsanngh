### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a computational scientist with a passion for leveraging computational models and algorithms to address complex scientific problems.

As a Ph.D. candidate at Michigan State University, my research integrates physics-informed machine learning with traditional numerical methods to develop efficient cardiovascular models for medical diagnostics and treatments.

I am actively seeking opportunities to expand my knowledge and apply my skills in real-world scenarios, particularly in high-performance computing, machine learning, and biomechanics.
